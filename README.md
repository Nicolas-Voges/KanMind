## Overview

KanMind provides a RESTful API for managing boards, tasks, and comments in a Kanban-style workflow. The backend is built with Django and Django REST Framework (DRF) and supports:

- User registration, login, and token-based authentication  
- Board creation, updates, deletion, and membership-based access control  
- Task creation, editing, assignment, and status tracking  
- Commenting on tasks with validation and permission checks  

## Features

- **Token-based Authentication** via Django REST Framework's authtoken  
- **Role-based permissions**: board owner, board member, task creator, task reviewer  
- **Model validation** to ensure data integrity (e.g., a comment must belong to a task)  
- **Clean and modular structure** with separate apps for authentication (`user_auth_app`) and business logic (`kanban_app`)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher  
- A virtual environment (recommended)
